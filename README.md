**POSSTARS AI Intelligent Recognition System**
With the recovery of the global retail industry and changes in consumer behavior, from small convenience stores to large supermarkets, new developments are being explored in order to achieve business growth. Intelligent digital management upgrades and secure payments are unavoidable for all retailers. Based on these common needs, POSSTARS will provide online and offline integrated retail solutions, integrate various functions such as cashier, mobile payment, ordering, takeaway, marketing activities, VIP membership management, and provide multiple terminals.

**Project Introduction**



AI vision checkout terminal is a self-service device that utilizes artificial intelligence and computer vision to complete an automatic object identification and checkout process. Smart retail is becoming a trend. Based on its own advantages in cashier systems, ERP software, AI visual recognition technology, mobile payment and other fields, POSSTARS is specifically developing intelligent solutions for smart retail, such as goods recognition, AI visual settlement, AI fresh produce weighing, customer identity recognition, commodity consumption management and control, and convenient payment.

**Feature Advantages**

It supports offline recognition, offline training, and offline learning. It is a high-performance deep learning inference engine for multiple terminals and platforms.
It supports ARM CPUs such as Qualcomm, MTK, and RK, Jetson, X86 CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, etc.
It supports multiple platforms: including Android, iOS, embedded Linux devices, Windows, macOS and Linux hosts.
Multiple scenarios: recognition of fresh fruits and vegetables, identification of non-standard products like grains and cereals, recognition of snack foods, vehicle recognition, recognition of animals and plants, etc.

**Visual Settlement Process**
The system automatically recognizes the goods placed by consumers in the settlement area through cameras, replacing the traditional way of manual scanning and enabling quick settlement, thus improving the shopping experience.



Product recognition (elevating checkout efficiency through POSSTARS AI identification system, with speed will up to milliseconds, eliminating the need to memorize item barcodes, easy to use for anyone, effectively boosting operational efficiency while offering customers a smoother, faster, and more user-friendly self-service weighing and checkout experience.)

**AI Front-End Hardware Recognition Camera Module**





In this project we aim at the identification of 4 different fruits: tomatoes, bananas, apples and mangoes. From these we defined 4 different classes by fruits:Â *single fruit*,Â *group of fruit*,Â *fruit in bag*,Â *group of fruit in bag*. An additional class for an empty camera field has been added which puts the total number of classes to 17. A dataset of 20 to 30 images per class has been generated using the same camera as for predictions. In total we got 338 images. Example images for each class are provided in Figure 1 below.



Below you can see a couple of short videos that illustrates how well our model works for fruit detection.
